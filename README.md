# Project 1: Shared shopping list

The Shopping List project is a web application designed to help users track specific goals they create. For instance, users can generate lists of grocery items they need or create task lists. All tasks can be marked as completed, and lists can be deactivated, making them invisible. On the main page, users can view statistics that display both deactivated and active lists' amount, along with the number of items marked as collected and those that are still pending.
